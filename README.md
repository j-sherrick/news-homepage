## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Sass
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned quite a bit of Sass, and a whole lot of 'what not to do' for next time. I lost track of the organization of this project because it took me so long to get around to finishing it and it is my first foray into Sass and the BEM architecture. The JavaScript for the modal mobile menu also feels extremely hacky and could use some refactoring.

### Continued development

- Sass
- JavaScript

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Extremely popular for a reason
- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified)
